# Errata

1. Bramley, N. R., Dayan, P., Griffiths, T. L. & Lagnado, D. A. ([2017](../pdfs/bramley2017neurath.pdf)). Formalizing Neurath's ship: Approximate algorithms for online causal learning. *Psychological Review*, Vol 124 (3), 301-338.  
Two sub figures are wrong in the published manuscript.  These were mistakenly drawn from Bramley, Dayan & Lagnado's (2015) Experiment 1 instead of the new Experiments.

In the camera ready version of the paper, Figure 2 was missing numerical annotations required to link it to the procedure described in the main text.  These are corrected in the figure below and in the copy on this site.

Due to a typographical error for Experiment 1, participants did not face world 3 but rather faced world 6 twice (i.e. _Target Force_ in Column 3 of Table 1 was incorrectly set as _N=none_).  However, as different distractor forces, starting conditions, and colours were selected and trials were without feedback, this only effects the relative size of our statistical comparison groups rather than impacting systematically on the experience of the participants. Mass and force were crossed in the design so participants still faced cases with cases of attraction repulsion, no force and both balanced and unbalanced masses.  They simply experienced _no force_ on four trials and _attract_ on only two trials instead of three each.  To the best of our knowledge, all statistical results and degrees of freedom in the published manuscript still correctly reflect the data.

In the published version of this chapter, Figure 2 g and h display an arrow from X1 to X3, these should be running from X2 to X3.  Additionally in section 3.4 the sentence "Here the X1 -> X2 and the X1 -> X2 delays are uncorrelated." should read "Here the X1 -> X2 and the X1 -> X3 delays are uncorrelated." Both these errors are corrected in the preprint hosted [here](../pdfs/bramley2019intervening.pdf).
