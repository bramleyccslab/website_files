# Bramley Lab Research

The goal of our research is to better understand the algorithms, processes and representations that underpin human intelligence. We generally approach this problem by developing computational theories of human learning representation and control. We design challenging and interactive tasks that distill elements of the challenges faced by natural cognition (see [**Demos**](/demo)) and have people and our models attempt to solve them.  By comparing the behaviour of our models to that of people, we can gain insight into the mechanisms that people use to to solve problems and adapt their behaviour. As well as helping us understand human intelligence, insights from our research can inform the development of artificial systems capable of learning and behaving in more flexible and human-like ways.

We are particularly interested in how people succeed at learning in the face of the world's radical complexity.  We explore how people build up complex hypotheses, ideas and [**causal theories**](#causal-cognition) in settings where there are too many (or even an [**infinite number**](#discovery) of possibilities.  A novelty of our research is focus on [**active learning**](#active-learning), i.e. studying how people act on the world and choose what to observe in service of their learning and control goals.  We investigate this in settings that involve different statistical cues from [**contingencies**](#causal-cognition) to continuous [**temporal**](#time-and-causality) and [**spatial dynamics**](#physical-causality).  Going a step further, we are exploring model based [**control**](#control)--i.e. situations where one balance learning a model of the environment with exploiting that model to achieve some goal.

To give you a better sense of some of the basic scientific questions we are interested in, we highlighted below some of our main lines of current research. The lab paper [**archive**](/publication) has a full list of papers with abstracts, pdfs, and links to the experiments, data and other resources.
