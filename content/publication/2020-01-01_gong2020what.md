abstract = "How do people use temporal information to make causal structure judgments?  A number of studies have investigated the role of time in inferring generative causal structure, while few have examined prevention.  Here, we focus on a challenging task in which participants learn the structure of several causal “devices” on the basis of short clips showing the de-vices’ patterns of activation over time. Each device potentially includes both generative and preventative causal relationships, such that activation of a cause component either produces an activation of its effect (generation) or blocks any activations within a short time window (prevention). We examine judgment patterns through the lens of a normative model which in-corporates actual causal attribution with considerations of prevention. We contrast this with more computationally tractable feature-based heuristics as well as cognitively plausible local-computation approximations.  Participants’ performance was substantially above chance in all conditions. The majority of participants’ causal judgments were best fit by a feature-based approximation while a minority was better aligned with the normative-noisy model or local-computation approximations."
