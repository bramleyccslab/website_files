abstract = "Many people are highly effective active causal learners, able to learn fully probabilistic structures over multiple interventions. Most people are forgetful conservative scholars - querying the environment to reduce their uncertainty, rather than their probability of being correct or expected payout, forgetting old evidence as they go along, but mitigating this by being conservative about their existing beliefs. Heuristic models can capture these patterns with a mixture of simple endorsement and disambiguation steps."
