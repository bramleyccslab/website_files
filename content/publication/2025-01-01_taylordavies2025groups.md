abstract = "Social learning can be a powerful tool, allowing us to acquire knowledge and adaptive behaviours while bypassing many of the the costs of learning through direct experience. However, not everyone is equally suitable to learn from as others' values can vary dramatically. In this paper, we consider the problem of selectively learning from others on the basis of inferences about their task-relevant preferences. Compounding this challenge, we have to make such inferences indirectly by generalizing across individuals based on whatever cues we can observe. We focus specifically on understanding how this problem leads inferences about cues to group identity and so develop a formal account that reconciles seemingly disparate evidence about people's group-based selective social learning. Across three behavioural experiments, we demonstrate that people are sensitive to the contextual significance of group identity cues when choosing who to learn from in partially observed environments. We show that this behaviour cannot be accounted for by a range of simpler heuristic strategies."
