abstract = "A recent theory advances the hypothesis that the human ability for physical reasoning relies upon a sophisticated ability for mental simulation. According to this theory, physical problems are approached by simulating scenarios multiple times, with noise, and making judgments based on the aggregation of the outcomes of the simulations. %This theory makes specific predictions which can be tested to investigate the theory further.  In this paper, we describe three experiments involving simple physical judgments and predictions, and argue their results are generally inconsistent with the core predictions of simulation theory."
