abstract = "Recent work has shown that people use temporal information including order, delay, and variability to infer causality between events. In this study we build on this work by investigating the role of time in dynamic systems, where causes take continuous values and also continually influence their effects. Recent studies of learning in these systems explored short interactions in a setting with comparatively rapidly evolving dynamics and modeled people as relying on simpler, resource-limited strategies to grapple with the stream of information. A natural question that arises from such an account is whether interacting with systems that unfold more slowly might potentially allow for more considered interactions and judgments. We find that slowing the task indeed reduces previously found systematic errors but comes at the cost of reducing overall accuracy due to the reduction in the total information available. To capture the differences between conditions, we introduce a novel Causal Event Segmentation model based on the notion that people compress the continuous scenes into events and use these to drive structure inference."
