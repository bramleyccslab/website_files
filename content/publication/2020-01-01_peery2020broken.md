abstract = "One remarkable aspect of human cognition is our ability to reason intuitively about physical events. This paper provides novel evidence that intuitive physics is subject to a peculiar error, the classic conjunction fallacy (Tversky & Kahenman, 1982). In the conjunction fallacy, people rate the probability of a conjunction of two events as more likely than one constituent (a logical impossibility). In a pair of studies, participants viewed snippets of videos of simple physical situations and judged the probability that either a single or a conjunction event would subsequently occur. In Study 1, 72% of participants consistently rated conjunction events as more likely than single events for the same scenes. Study 2 extends these results to rule out several alternative explanations. The demonstration of conjunction fallacy errors in intuitive physical judgments has broad implications for human reasoning in general and for theories of physical reasoning based on mental simulation in particular."
