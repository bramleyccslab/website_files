abstract = "An open question regarding how people develop theories or models of the world is how candidates are generated for consideration out of infinitely many possibilities. We discuss the role that evolutionary mechanisms of random mutation and selection play in this process. Specifically, we argue that theory change is necessarily incremental, and when it comes to developing models of the world, this entails blind mutation and recombination of (parts of) earlier models. We argue that, by narrowing and guiding exploration, this feature of cognitive search allows human learners to discover better theories, without having to solve the problem of finding a global optimum, or best possible world model. We suggest algorithms developed for program induction provide candidate mechanisms for how human minds might achieve this. We discuss implications of this perspective, arguing that a better process-level understanding of how humans incrementally explore compositional theory spaces can shed light on how we think, and provide explanatory traction on fundamental cognitive biases including anchoring, probability matching and confirmation bias."
