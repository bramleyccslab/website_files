abstract = "Scientific experiments in behavioral research are commonly designed following tradition or heuristics, relying on a scientist's intuitions and domain experience. Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) formalizes this procedure by identifying experiments that are expected to yield informative data. This requires formal implementations of theories, expressed by means of mathematical or computational models. Often, computational models are constructed such that they favor mathematical and computational convenience, where all quantities are either available in closed-form or can be computed easily. However, computational convenience usually comes at the cost of realism; more expressive simulator models that can capture the richness of complex phenomena, such as human behavior, require an expanded methodological toolkit. In this work, we leverage recent advances in BOED and machine learning to find optimal experiments for complex models without likelihoods, further yielding approximate sufficient summary statistics and amortized posterior distributions, which allow for quick and straightforward evaluation of models against real experimental data. As a case study, we consider theories of how people balance exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit decision-making tasks. We validate our method using simulations and a real-world experiment. As compared to experimental designs commonly used in the literature, we show that our optimal designs more efficiently determine which of a set of models best account for individual human behavior, and more efficiently characterize behavior given a preferred model."
