abstract = "The rise of large language models and their impressive capabilities prompted many to say the Turing test has been passed unequivocably. But do people have clear or accurate intuitions about how the agent evoked, or mimicked, by a large language model differs from an actual human? How do people conceive of the inner states of artificial agents, and of how these differ from the mental states of natural agents? One way to get at these intuitions is to explore how people interrogate systems to decide whether they are natural or artificial. We probed this across a series of studies in which a first set of participants generate Turing test questions, a second rate their quality and a third judge whether answers to these questions were in fact generated by humans or artificial systems. For the third phase, we obtained answers to the first group's suggested questions from a sample of adults, large language models and voice assistants. %Turing test using questions generated by people for that purpose. We analyse the topics of the tester's questions and the match between their perceived and actual effectiveness. Despite claims the Turing test is becoming obsolete, we argue it endures as a probe of laypeople's evolving intuitions about artificial intelligence and a way to track the expansion of theory of mind to encompass different sorts of mind. We highlight some systematic mismatches between participants' expectations and reality, and discuss how our results shed light on what people think separates humans from machines."
