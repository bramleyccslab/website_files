abstract = "Humans are curious animals. From learning how to speak to launching rockets into space, inquisitive behaviour drives mankind's progress small and large. Yet little is known formally about curiosity. We put forward and assess a unifying theory of curiosity using a large scale data set within the game of Mastermind, a quintessential game of curiosity-driven problem solving that people report to be engaging and fun. Our results map out the landscape of human curiosity. These results have rich implications for psychological and neuroscientific research, the educational sciences, public policy decision makers, as well as economic stake holders."
