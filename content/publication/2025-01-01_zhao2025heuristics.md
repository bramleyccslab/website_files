abstract = "In daily life, we frequently interact with specialists——individuals whose complementary insights augment our limited first-hand experiences in decision-making. Efficient as this may be, the cognitive demands of employing our theory of mind to determine and integrate the evidential contributions of diverse experts may offset its benefits. In this study, we explore human judgments in a scenario where one must aggregate opinions from several social peers, each an expert in a different aspect of a problem. We examine participants' strategies with the aid of a normative Bayesian model and propose two heuristic approaches. Our results suggest that the majority of participants across two experiments relied on heuristics. Furthermore, as the normative integration problem grew more challenging, more participants turned to heuristics."
