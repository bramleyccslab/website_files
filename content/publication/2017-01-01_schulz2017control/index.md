abstract = "How do people explore in order to gain rewards in uncertain dynamical systems? Within a reinforcement learning paradigm, control normally involves trading off between exploration (i.e. trying out actions in order to gain more knowledge about the system) and exploitation (i.e. using current knowledge of the system to maximize reward). We study a novel control task in which participants must steer a boat on a grid, aiming to follow a path of high reward whilst learning how their actions affect the boatâ€™s position. We find that participants explore strategically yet conservatively, exploring more when mistakes are less costly and practicing actions that will be required later on"
