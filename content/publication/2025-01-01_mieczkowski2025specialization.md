abstract = "Multi-agent systems often rely on specialized agents with distinct roles rather than general-purpose agents that perform the entire task independently. However, the conditions that govern the optimal degree of specialization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that specialist teams outperform generalist ones when environmental constraints limit task parallelizability---the potential to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from distributed systems, we introduce a heuristic to predict the relative efficiency of generalist versus specialist teams by estimating the speed-up achieved when two agents perform a task in parallel rather than focus on complementary subtasks. We validate this heuristic through three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) experiments in Overcooked-AI, demonstrating that key factors limiting task parallelizability influence specialization. We also observe that as the state space expands, agents tend to converge on specialist strategies, even when generalist ones are theoretically more efficient, highlighting potential biases in MARL training algorithms. Our findings provide a principled framework for interpreting specialization given the task and environment, and introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating whether MARL finds optimal strategies."
