abstract = "A defining aspect of being human is an ability to reason about the world by generating and adapting ideas and hypotheses. Here we explore how this ability develops by comparing children's and adults' active search and explicit hypothesis generation patterns in a task that mimics the open-ended process of scientific induction. In our experiment, 54 children (aged 8.97+-1.11) and 50 adults performed inductive inferences about a series of causal rules through active testing. Children generated substantially more complex guesses about the hidden rules and were more elaborate in their testing behavior. We take a `computational constructivism' perspective to explaining these patterns, arguing that these inferences are driven by a combination of thinking (recombining and modifying existing symbolic concepts) and exploring (actively investigating and discovering patterns in the physical world).  We show how our approach and rich new dataset speak to questions about developmental differences in hypothesis generation, active learning and inductive generalization."
