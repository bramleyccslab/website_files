I'm interested in how people make decisions and how people learn to make better decisions. Specifically I'm interested in how external (e.g., the type of tasks) and internal factors (e.g., emotion) influence human decision making and the learning process. And my MSc project focuses on how people combine social learning and active learning in different settings.

My previous work mainly focused on the interplay between emotion and cognition, such as the relationship between emotion and creativity in children, and how emotion-related personality predicted moral decision-making in adults.
