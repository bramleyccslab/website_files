I am interested in the computational mechanisms underlying human cognition. Inspired by recent advancements in the Philosophy of Cognitive Science - the Free Energy Principle and  Predictive Processing approach to Cognition - I am curious to explore how these principles are reflected in computational models of causal cognition. Currently, I am investigating causal structure learning in continuous systems in general and the impact of mediating factors on those in particular.

Beyond the above mentioned project, I am interested in the neurological implementation of these computational mechanisms. I previously worked in the Non-invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) group at the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University. There I developed a new single-subject analysis to better understand cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying behavioural variability in the spatial orienting paradigm.
