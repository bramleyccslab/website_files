Human beings excel at physical reasoning. We can make predictions about object properties from mere observation like, for example, how likely an object is to fall from a table. We are also capable of *actively learning* objects' latent properties, such as their mass, by interacting with them. For instance, if asked about a ball's weight, we will most likely grab it and move it in our hands before guessing. Currently, I am investigating whether deep learning approaches are capable of such physical reasoning and how their abilities compare with humans. 

In general, I am very interested in Reinforcement Learning. I believe that by training agents to solve tasks previously evaluated in human beings, we can develop some basic understanding of how certain cognitive processes happen in the brain.
