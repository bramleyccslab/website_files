<!-- You can write $\LaTeX$ and *Markdown* here. -->

I build computational models of human cognition, with a particular interest in causal generalization.
I take a hybrid approach combining symbolic representations, Bayesian approximate inference, and online interactive experimentation.
My PhD was funded by a CAHSS/PPLS research award.

Please check my [**personal website**](https://zhaobn.github.io) for updates.
