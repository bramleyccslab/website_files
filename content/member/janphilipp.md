<!--  I am a PhD student in Neil Bramley's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of Edinburgh. -->

Hello! I am a PhD Student at The University of Edinburgh working in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://www.bramleylab.ppls.ed.ac.uk/) with [Neil Bramley](https://www.bramleylab.ppls.ed.ac.uk/member/neil/) and [Chris Lucas](https://lucaslab-uoe.github.io/members/chris/). I am broadly interested in building human-like intelligent machines and multi-agent environments for collective problem solving. 

My current research mainly focuses on how agents learn and adapt probabilistic programs in a challenging game of inductive logic ([Demo](http://zendo-cond-3.herokuapp.com/)). Additionally, I work on probabilistic and causal reasoning in multi-agent reasoning tasks ([Demo](https://eco.ppls.ed.ac.uk/~s1938897/space_fish/)). My PhD is funded by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation. 

Prior to joining The University of Edinburgh, I completed an MSc in Cognitive and Decision Sciences from University College London working with David Lagnado's [Causal Cognition Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/). During my time in London, I was also part of the [Computational Neuroscience & Psychiatry Group](https://www.pinotsislab.com/) where I worked with Dimitris Pinotsis.
