<!--  I am a PhD student in Neil Bramley's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of Edinburgh. -->

I am interested in multi-agent systems and probabilistic representations of beliefs (e.g., in graphical models). For example, I am interested in how optimal network configurations can be found to optimize network performance. Currently, I am investigating information cascades and the emergence of echo chambers through agent-based simulations. At the same time, I aim to develop a better understanding of how people deal with statistical dependencies in social learning. These findings might help to further improve current models of belief propagation.

Besides my PhD, I am working as a tutor in Research Methods and Statistics at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to joining UoE, I worked as a graduate reseracher in [Dimitris Pinotsis' Computational Neuroscience Lab](https://www.pinotsislab.com/) at City - University of London where I used dynamic causal modelling to investigate drivers of resting state activity in the rat's vibrissal somatosensory system. Prior to moving to London I worked as a research assistant in [Henry Otgaar's' Lab](https://henryotgaar.wixsite.com/henryotgaar) based in Maastricht. The results of my work as RA can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691818302385).

I am funded by a German Studienstiftung award (Germany's largest, oldest and most prestigious scholarship foundation).
