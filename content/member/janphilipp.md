<!--  I am a PhD student in Neil Bramley's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of Edinburgh. -->

Hi! I am a third-year PhD Student at The University of Edinburgh, working in the Computational Cognitive Science Lab with Neil Bramley and Chris Lucas. I currently work on representation and concept learning. A representative recent work can be found [**here**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028522000421).

Prior to joining The University of Edinburgh, I pursued a Master's degree in Cognitive and Decision Sciences from University College London working with David Lagnado's Causal Cognition Lab. During my time in London, I was also part of the Computational Neuroscience & Psychiatry Group where I collaborated with Dimitris Pinotsis (City, University of London) and Alan Jasanoff (MIT).
