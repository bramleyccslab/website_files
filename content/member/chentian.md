My research aims to build computational models that employ human-like learning strategies, with a focus on topics in causal learning, transfer learning, and program induction. People are able to learn causal relationships between unfamiliar objects and transfer these learned relationships to new tasks and new domains. I am interested in running behavioral experiments and building program induction models based on people's strategies for transferring causal knowledge.

I’m very grateful to be funded by Principal’s Career Development Scholarship and Edinburgh Global Research Scholarship.
