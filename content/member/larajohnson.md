I'm interested in how people interact with technology - how people learn to use and control computer systems, how to design system interfaces that are intuitive to use, how technology is impacting society and how ethical issues concerning the use of digital data are being navigated. For my Msc I'm looking at how and why people differ in learning to control a dynamic system, which provides feedback in real time, via an online experiment.
