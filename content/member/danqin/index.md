Hi! I am Danqin Zhao. You can also call me Foxxis. My research interests focus on social induction and human-AI interaction. Some key questions I explore include: How do people make inferences based on information from social peers? How do these inferences depend on varying conditions, such as differing levels of information dependency? And what happens when we replace their interacting partner with an AI agent? Answering these questions can help us better understand human behavior in social contexts and improve the design of human-AI interfaces.
You can find my latest work [**here**](/publication/), and an unofficial personal website [**here**](https://dqzhao.super.site).
