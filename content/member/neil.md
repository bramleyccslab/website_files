I am interested in higher level cognition, how we think about and represent the world and its alternatives and use these ability to plan, imagine, explain, blame and solve problems.  In my PhD I studied how people use interventions (roughly, actions that "tinker" with the world) to learn about causal relationships in a range of simple environments.

A major output of this work was a model of incremental, boundedly rational human learning in which wholesale belief change takes place through a sequence of local changes. This approach helps to explain how the mind deals with radical complexity.  I am now exploring expansions of this idea to model the discovery of new or novel theories and hypotheses.  This project involves probabilistic grammars and program induction ideas to explore theory generation in compositional and infinite theory spaces.

I have generally used interactive experiments and games combined with computational modelling to get at these questions.
