<!-- I am a cognitive scientist and Moore-Sloan post-doctoral associate in Todd Gureckis' computation and cognition lab and the Centre for Data Science at New York University.  -->


I am broadly interested in human learning and intelligence.  More specifically, I've studied how people gather new information during extended interactions with their environment and how they learn about and represent its causal structure. One of my key contributions is a model of incremental, boundedly rational human learning in which wholesale belief change takes place through a sequence of local changes. This approach is helping to explain how the mind deals with radical complexity, and demystifies notions like “curiosity” and “creativity” as precise algorithmic components of a flexible, incremental and active inferential system.

I generally use interactive experiments and games combined with computational modelling to study how people learn, represent, and reason about the world.

*I will be starting as a Lecturer in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Edinburgh from January 2019. Get in touch if you are interested in doing a PhD or postdoc!*
