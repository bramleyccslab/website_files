I am interested in using computational modelling to bridge the gap between mind and matter, specifically by understanding underlying behaviour in terms of systems neuroscience. My UG thesis centers around modelling peripersonal space in schizophrenia and cognitive therapy simulation (in the form of tool-use training). I wish to see whether such an intervention shows symptom improvement, and, if so, through what neuronal mechanisms.

Originally I am from Bucharest, Romania, although both of my parents migrated from Moldova. I am very passionate about mindfulness and regularly practice meditation and yoga. I see these habits as running my own inner research experiments and observing the phenomenological results!

I wish to pursue an academic career and hopefully make meaningful change as a politician later on - we need more scientists in leadership roles!
