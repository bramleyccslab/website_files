Hi! I'm an MScR student in the Department of Psychology, supervised by Neil Bramley. I'm looking into human concept learning, trying to figure out how humans incrementally enrich their concept libraries when facing diverse scenarios, different learning curricula and envirnomental and resource pressures. I'm also interested in investigating the influence of the environment (e.g. the sufficiency of ressources at hand) on how we form representations, make decisions and interact with others, and how the socicial inferences further enhance this.

I previously studied computer science at Beihang University; machine learning and natural language processing to be more precise. Apart from my master's project applying Diffusion Models to text generation (email me if you're interested or want to read the thesis!), I did an internship at Megvii as an AI engineer in Beijing. During this, I had experience implementing LLMs and Diffusion Models in real-life commercial applications. I had the privilege to do a double diploma program in Marseille, France, from 2020 to 2022, during which time a research internship on language acquisition led me to the world of computational cognitive science.
