Hi! I'm a PhD student in the robotics CDT at Edinburgh, supervised by Chris Lucas. My work is guided by the two complementary goals of (1) understanding *human* social cognition and learning at the computational level, and (2) building *AI* systems that can effectively reason about and learn from other agents. 

I previously studied bioengineering, and worked as a software engineer and (briefly) in a neuroscience lab.
