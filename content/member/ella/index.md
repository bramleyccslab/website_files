My research area is in child semantic and pragmatic acquisition, and how we might model this computationally. In particular, I am very interested in lexical acquisition and discourse structures, as well as expanding my work to look at cross-cultural and cross-lingual data. 

I am originally from Fife in Scotland. In 2019, I moved down to Oxford to pursue my BA in Psychology and Linguistics at St Hugh's College, University of Oxford. My undergraduate Psychology research project examined potential sources of cross-cultural variation in logical reasoning. I began my PhD in 2022, supervised by Hugh Rabagliati and Neil Bramley.

My PhD is funded by the Natural Language Processing Centre for Doctoral Training.
