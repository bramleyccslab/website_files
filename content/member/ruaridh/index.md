I am interested in how humans collaborate and in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents to help in collaborative scenarios, such as cooking. Currently, my focus is on understanding individual differences and runnning large-scale behavioral experiments to improve our understanding of effective collaboration strategies. I have also enjoyed working on enabling robots to perform complex dynamic tasks, such as making coffee! Broadly, my PhD encompasses topics such as robotic manipulation, machine learning, and cognitive modeling.

My PhD is generously funded by the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics CDT, and I am incredibly fortunate to be supervised by Chris Lucas, Neil Bramley, Julie Shah (while at MIT) and Tom Griffiths (while at Princeton).

I am from Ilkley and recommend exploring the beautiful Yorkshire dales!
