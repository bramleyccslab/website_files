I’m interested in understanding how people learn causal representations from observational data and interventions. My current research focuses on causal structure learning from temporal information, hidden causes and Bayesian experimental design. I use behavioural experiments, causal inference and machine learning methods to build computational models that aim to improve our understanding of cognition and inform the design of more capable artificial learning systems.

My PhD is generously funded by the Principal’s Career Development Scholarship and I’m supervised by Chris Lucas and Neil Bramley.
