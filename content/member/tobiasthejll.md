I'm interested in all things learning.  Specifically, for my MSc I'm looking at how people actively learn about the world by interacting and trying hypotheses while in a social context with another learner.  Understanding how social and active learning interact can help inform education, another big passion of mine, and safe human-like AI. 

I've previously worked in the higher education sector developing educational resources for reflective learning and for how to embed student development and employability into the curriculum without compromising subject learning.
