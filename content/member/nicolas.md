I am interested in studying human learning by modeling the mental representations of causality and concepts more broadly.
I aim to make use of theories from natural language semantics to inform the class of mental representations used in causal inference and hypothesis formation.

I am originally from Colombia, but I grew up in Canada where I studied Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia.
With an emerging interest in artificial intelligence, I turned to study the human mind at the [Cogmaster](https://psl.eu/en/education/cognitive-science-cogmaster) in Paris.
Through interactions with the linguistics department of the Cogmaster, I was inspired to apply natural language semantics to models of learning and reasoning.
Now, I will be working with Neil Bramley and Dan Lassiter to merge these theoretical and computational approaches.
