I build computational models of human cognition, with a particular interest in causal generalization.
I take a hybrid approach combining symbolic representations, Bayesian approximate inference, and online interactive experimentation.

I grew up in eastern China, and studied philosophy for my bachelor's at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
With a yearning desire for rationality and formal systems, I crossed the continent and pursued MSc in Logic at the Institute of Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)) in Amsterdam.
There, I discovered cognitive science.
After my MSc, I worked two years in data science and engineering in an Amsterdam startup.
Though the job was fun and the team was great, I kept hearing a strong inner call for researching the human mind, especially with all the latest computational methods.
That brought me to Edinburgh, doing my PhD with Neil and Chris, supported by a PhD Research Award from the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
