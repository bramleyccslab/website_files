How do people use previous experience to navigate through novel situations?
What's the role of causal reasoning in these processes?
How do we solve the intractibility problem of Bayesian inference in modeling causal generalization?
I study these questions using interactive online experiments and a hybrid approach combining symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques.

Before my PhD, I was a data scientist/engineer in a Dutch adtech startup.
I obtained my MSc in Logic from the Institute of Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)) at the University of Amsterdam,
and a Bachelor in Philosophy from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.
My name is 赵博囡 in simplified Chinese - pronunciation with tones: Zhào-Bó-Nān.

I am funded by a PhD Research Award from the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
