    #Much of the lab's research focuses on how people learn about causal structure and how they gather new information during extended interactions with their environment.    The lab is run by Neil Bramley.  I am a new lecturer in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Edinburgh.  Previously a Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment postdoc at New York University. In my personal line of research, I use interactive experiments and games combined with computational modelling to study how people learn, represent, and reason about the world."
